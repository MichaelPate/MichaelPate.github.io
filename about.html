    I am Michael Pate, a hobbyist computer engineer in high school. I have
    interests in just about every field of computer science and electronics.
    I am currently a high school senior at Kelly Walsh high school, and I plan
    to attend the Colorado School of Mines and Technology next year. I plan to
    major in computer engineering with a minor in electrical engineering.
